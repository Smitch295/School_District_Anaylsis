# School_District_Anaylsis

## Overview of the school district analysis:
Maria was notified that the students_complete csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically in the math and reading scores. We are tasked with replacing math and reading scores at Thomas High School with Nans and repeat the school district analysis that we did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results:

There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
